get the parts of speech for each word in the image.  for each noun, get the one that has the most occurances.  in case of a tie get the noun that appears first.  get the pixel coordinates of that noun.
Need to have an image for singular and plural casseroles.  Replace the NNS and NNPS words with the plural image only.  Same for single.

use python natural language toolkit (nltk) library
https://www.nltk.org/
search for NN, NNS, NNP, and NNPS tags
------------------------
overlay the casserole image(s) onto the first image at the coordinates of each of the targetted words.  might have to first resize the casserole image based on the width/height of each word it is overlaying.

can use python imaging library (PIL)

syntactic dependency:  determine direct object
is it part of stop list (most common words in language):  no


weight these as percentages so that it's pseudo-random:

1.  Singular noun?  (NN, NNP)
2.  Not in stop list?
3.  Direct object depedency?
4.  Compound dependency?


ranked lists per category:

++ Nouns (NN, NNP)
+  Pronouns (PRP)  (always replace with plural "casseroles")
0  Words it doesn't understand

--what about sentences with no nouns/pronouns?
Learn to swim, learn to fly

--how to chunk text into sentences (if multiple sentences in the meme)?  Sentences are important in order to determine accurate dependency tags.
